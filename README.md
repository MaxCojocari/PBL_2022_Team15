# PBL_sem1_2022
This is the repository for PBL project, sem.1 2022

If you work for the first time with this repository, clone it! 

```
git clone git@github.com:MaxCojocari/PBL_sem2.git
```

If you already done it, use:

1. `git fetch` - if you want to see if there are changes available in the remote repository without bringing the changes into the local repository;
2. `git pull` - if you want to transfer changes from remote to local.

It's highly recomended to create a distinct branch in order to not polute `main` with unexpected changes. Use `git checkout -b <your_branch>` for this purpose.

Please, if you don't know how to manipulate this repo, don't make a mess out of it!!!

For other questions or sweet thoughts please ask the owner of this repo))
